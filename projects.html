                                <h4>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)</h4>
                            
                                <p> FRBs are mysterious pulses of 
                                    radio waves that come from the distant Universe. 
                                    They typically last for just a millisecond, but can 
                                    be as short at ~ten microseconds.
                                    I study their origins and potential 
                                    as cosmological probes. Specifically, I am interested in 
                                    using the dispersion of FRBs to map out the Universe's 
                                    baryon cosmic web, the exact distribution of which has 
                                    a significant impact on 
                                    galaxy formation and precision cosmology.</p>

                                <p>
                                    The animation on the right shows an FRB 
                                    travelling through the IllustrisTNG simulation and the 
                                    corresponding dispersion measure from ionized plasma in 
                                    the baryon cosmic web. After ~20 seconds
                                    the pulses passes through a massive galaxy cluster, rapidly boosting 
                                    its dispersion measure. Feel free to use it!

                            <p> The DSA-110 is an array of 5 m dishes at Caltech's 
                                Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)
                                that was built with the express purpose of discovering 
                                FRBs and localizing them to their host galaxies. 
                                Since 2022, we have amassed a significant sample 
                                of localized FRBs, which we follow up with optical 
                                and infrared instruments at the W. M. Keck Observatory and Palomar 
                                Observatory. Studying this sample has led to some fascinating 
                                results and continues to be great fun!

                            <h4>Surveys: The DSA-2000</h4>
                            <p> The DSA-2000 takes the small-dish, many antennas paradigm 
                                to its extreme. This planned telescope will 
                                be the most powerful radio array ever constructed when it sees 
                                first light in 2027. While 
                                its predecessor (DSA-110) had a focused goal of localizing FRBs, the 
                                DSA-2000 is a broad survey instrument that will map 
                                the entire visible sky down to 500 nJy, discover large swaths of 
                                new pulsars and FRBs, detect nanoHz gravitational waves, and much more.

                            <p> Imaging the sky with an interferometric array of radio antennas 
                                requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem known as deconvolution. 
                                Significant progress has been made recently by the computer vision 
                                community on a similar class of problems, using 
                                efficient neural network architectures. My colleagues and I have 
                                developed these tools for superresolution imaging in radio astronomy, 
                                which will enable telescopes like the DSA-2000 to find hundreds of 
                                thousand of strong gravitational lenses that would otherwise be 
                                too blurry to detect.

                            <p> I am interested in using modern machine learning 
                                techniques to reconstruct cosmological 3D fields 
                                from astronomical observations. This includes 
                                a collaboration with Caltech computational 
                                cameras group and Google Research that seeks to 
                                reconstruct the intervening 
                                dark matter field causing weak lensing 
                                of distant galaxies. I am also in the early 
                                stages of studying how to do this for the baryon cosmic 
                                web, which traces the dark matter large-scale structure 
                                but deviates in important ways at small scales.

                                <h4>Hardware: Coherent All-Sky Monitor (CASM)</h4>
                                <p> Although still in the conceptual phase, I'd 
                                    eventually like to build a large "dense aperture array" 
                                    to search 10,000 square degrees for fast radio 
                                    phenomena. Such a telescope could find strongly lensed FRBs, 
                                    coherent emission  
                                    coincident with gravitational wave events,and Galactic 
                                    magnetars. Similar efforts are underway around the 
                                    world (e.g. BURSTT in Taiwan or CHARTS in Chile), 
                                    as radio astronomers 
                                    are taking advantage of the tremendous gains brought 
                                    forth by modern signal processing hardware 
                                    such as AMD's Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) and 
                                    Tensor Cores on GPUs. An early effort has begun at 
                                    OVRO to build a simple 16-element array shown a cartoon rendering 
                                    made by Michael Gutierrez.</p>

                                My collaborators and I have built
                                the Global Radio eXplorer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09905.pdf" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 179)">GReX</a> , rhymes with 
                                "T-Rex") as an international all-sky monitor that 
                                will continuously survey the Galaxy for ultrabright bursts at 1.4 GHz 
                                with ~10 microsecond time resolution. Clusters of three radio 
                                antennas will be placed around the world in order to 
                                find more Galactic FRBs, super giant pulses from pulsars, 
                                and whatever unknown phenomena occupies this underexplored volume of 
                                parameter space. Thus far, we have sent GReX terminals to 
                                OVRO, Cornell, Harvard, Hat Creek Observatory, Ireland, and Australia.
